Mouse control via webcam:

Let ur hand open facing cam to control the mouse movement
The mouse moves as your hand moves in the cam range

Cross ur thumb to block mouse movement and use the clicks:
- Index finger down = left button
- Middle finger down = right button
- Both down touching ur thumb = double click

You can let ur ring finger and little finger down holding your thumb if helps (I think its easier that way)


Yes, there's a lot of options and fuctions that you can add to the program, but I just wanted to do these to practice.
